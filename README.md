# Jasmine People

Fork and clone this repo to get started. We've already set up an empty Rails app, but you'll need to set up Jasmine on your own. Follow the steps under **Installation** in the [jasmine-rails README](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-rails).

## Assignment

Use test-driven development to create a `Person` "class" (remember, technically [there are no classes in JavaScript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2752868/does-javascript-have-classes)). A `Person` must be initialized with a `firstName` and a `lastName`, plus any of the following optional properties:

* `age` (in years, default to 30)
* `weight` (in kilograms, default to 80)
* `height` (in centimeters, default to a random value between 150 and 200)
* `friends` (an array of other `Person` objects, default to empty)

I should also be able to call these functions on a `Person`:

* `fullName` should return the person's first name plus their last name
* `weightInStone` should return the person's weight in [stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_%28unit%29)
* `addFriend` should take a `Person` object and add it to the person's friends
* `removeFriend` should take a name string and remove the person with that name from the person's friends, if there is such a friend
* `greetPeople` should return a string that greets an optional array of `Person` objects (default to the person's friends) by their full names, with an optional greeting (default to `"Hi"`). If no people are provided and the person has no friends, the function should throw an error.

## Grading

* **(2)** Person initialization and default values working and tested
* **(5)** One point for each of the specified functions working and tested
* **(1)** Code has good style/naming and adheres to best practices
* **(2)** Repository has clean, logical, single-task commits with descriptive messages
